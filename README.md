# Employee-Tracker
## An employee-tracking application.

It would be very helpful to have a tool to automatically update the employee management database in order to add new employees, update employee roles, add new roles, and add new departments, as well as view all employees, view all roles, and view all departments.

The user must be able select from appropriate lists in order to provide the program with the data to update, such as first and last names, and role as well as manager.

# Testing
A jest test harness will be created when time allows. In the meantime, using MySQL's workbench tool to verify that the database is correctly updated would be a good idea.

# Functionality
The user starts the program by typing in node server. They are then given the list of options.

If the user views a department, role, or all employees, they are then given a table with the information.

If the user adds a role, department or employee, they are asked to give the information required. Then the datase is updated as required.

When the user selects exit, the application quits. Up until then, the application offers the appropriate menu to the user.
